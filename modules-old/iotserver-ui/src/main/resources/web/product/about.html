<h1>WSO2 Enterprise Store 1.0.0</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 Enterprise Store (UES) unlocks enterprise data for business intelligence, monitoring
    and other
    enterprise requirements. Empowering not only developers but business users as well, WSO2 UES
    helps to rapidly create
    visually appealing and engaging web components such as dashboard, microsites and gadgets.
    Providing server-side
    capabilities out-of-the-box, going from data to screen has never been easier.

    WSO2 UES includes an inbuilt Jaggery.js editor, site browser and graphical composer for
    dashboards. Tightly
    integrated to an enterprise store of Open Social Gadgets and microsites, users can build
    dashboards, microsites and
    gadgets with 3rd party data sources, and even share them among authenticated users across the
    enterprise.

    Leverage the award-winning WSO2 Carbon midldleware platform’s QoS features and Jaggery.js
    flexibility of writing
    server-side code without compiling or building, with the WSO2 Enterprise Store.

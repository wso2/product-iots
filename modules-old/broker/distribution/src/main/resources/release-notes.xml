            <h1>WSO2 Message Broker (MB) 3.1.0 Released!</h1>

            <p>
                The WSO2 Message Broker team is pleased to announce the 3.1.0 release of WSO2 Message Broker (MB).
            </p>
            <p>WSO2 MB is a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Distributed Message Brokering
                Server (MB) which is available under the Apache Software License v2.0.

                This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
                framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon
                components.
            </p>
            <p>
                WSO2 MB v 3.1.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary
                <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a> (Middleware a' la carte),
                an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
                componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of optional
                components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior of the MB. Further, any
                existing features of the MB which are not required to your environment can be easily
                removed using the underlying provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 MB can
                be fully customized and tailored to meet your exact SOA needs.
            </p>
